# CreditCardChecker
Codecademy project Credit Card Checker

One of the first projects from the Full-Stack Software Engineering Career Pathway on Codecademy.

Written fully in JavaScript, the project's puprose is to determine whether credit card numbers issued by distributor companies are valid or not.
There are three main functions that break down arrays of numbers and using Luhn's algorithm (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm#Description)
check the card number's validity. The end result is to return an array of names for each company who might've issued the INVALID numbers, based on the
first digit of the number that's unique to the company (list of unique digits provided by Codecademy in the project description).

Example arrays have been provided by Codecademy, but anything below '// Add your functions below:' is written by me.
